Poor accessible experience causes confusion, frustration, inaccuracy, and even lawsuits.

If you want to create great customer service / brand experience, use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 as a guide to better understand and anticipate how users with diverse abilities will use the products/services. 

Based a website scenario, this poster highlights the frequent challenges that People with Disabilities (PwD), e.g. motor, physical, cognitive, etc. will face and how an accessible experience can resolve them.
